chooseFilesystem.setup.name=Home Folders
chooseFilesystem.summary=There are several different ways that I can set up the file system. Choose an option from below that matches your requirements.

choice1.header=Home Folders
choice1.paragraph=Multiple users will use the file system, all of which require their home directory to be separated and removed from other users' folders. Users will not be able to access other users' home directories. 

choice2.header=Shared Home
choice2.paragraph=You do not want to use home folders. Either because you do not intend on supporting multiple users or that users you provide access to will share the same root folder when they log into the service.

choice3.header=Setup Later
choice3.paragraph=Just create a read-only root file system. You will reconfigure the file system after I've poked around a little.
